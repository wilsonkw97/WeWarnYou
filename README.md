<h2>The flood crisis which has started in Dec 17, 2021, has since hit 8 states in Malaysia. In certain areas, residents are hit with landslides. Having claimed 50 people' lives across 3 different states and displacing 125,490 citizens from their homes, this flood incident has last happened back in 1971 according to our King. The idea behind this project is to create a support system amongst the people in the country to help alert one another when another similar crisis occurs, rather than waiting for alerts by the NADMA which may come late.</h2>
